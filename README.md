# Wool
That thing.
The main page is at Wool.html.

INTRODUCTION:
  This is a project part of VinUniversity's entrepreneurship "boot camp" - WOOL.
  Wool is developed for a teeny tiny little hackathon session before the main event.
  The fictional company is "DreamBIT" - and yes, it's purpose is also fictional.
  Wool is not going to receive any further development.

DREAMBIT:
  DreamBIT the name might exist out there, but this is, again, a little exercise to practice.
  It is a company that offers a product that monitors users' behavior and suggest changes accordingly.
  The product's image is also in the file, just in case.
  This is not a fully-developed website, and the product is only fictional.

THE TEAM:
  The solution was devised by a 5-member team, with a member who scored high in another competition else where.
  It took not too much time, and this was a fun little challenge besides the main practice.
  It took 4 hours to program.
  Initially it took on a more simplistic appearance, but the appearance had to look professional (well, it has got to).

CONCLUSION:
  My code was, fortunately, featured in the main presentation.
  Thanks to all the team members for having spared their precious time reviewing the code and design.
  Appreciation.
  Anyways, this program is a great chance to test typing speed.

THAT'S IT. ENJOY THE LITTLE EXCURSION THROUGH THIS MESSY CODE FOLDER.
